# Anima Regia Scraper
Node Js program to scrape manga pages from AnimaRegia

## The problem:
The pt-BR translation of Yowamushi Pedal on mangadex was not up to date, so I decided to update, but as I'm lazy I made a script to automate the process.

## The Solution:
Short answer: [this](https://github.com/ArthurSegato/AnimaRegiaScraper).

Long answer: This script connects to the translators' website, downloads the pages and chapter titles and uploads them to the Mangadex API.
